# Semiconductor Market Data AWS Pipeline

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project involves the design and deployment of a **cloud-based data pipeline** to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of global semiconductor market data. The pipeline is built using **Python, AWS (Lambda, S3, Redshift, EC2, EventBridge)** and visualized in **Power BI**. It is **deployed and automated** to update data every 15 days.

## üèóÔ∏è Workflow
1. **Data Extraction (Python)**: Scraped semiconductor market data from a website using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation (Python, Pandas)**: Processed and cleaned raw data using `pandas`.
3. **Cloud Storage (AWS S3)**: Uploaded cleaned data as CSV to **AWS S3** bucket.
4. **Pipeline Automation (AWS Lambda + EventBridge)**: Automated pipeline execution using **Lambda**, scheduled every 15 days with **EventBridge**.
5. **Data Warehousing (Amazon Redshift)**: Loaded S3 data into **Amazon Redshift Serverless** for querying and analysis.
6. **Visualization (Power BI)**: Connected **Power BI** to **Redshift** for real-time data visualization.

## üîë Key Features
- **Fully Automated ETL Pipeline** leveraging **AWS Cloud Services**.
- **Cloud-Based Storage & Data Processing** with **S3** and **Redshift**.
- **Scheduled Data Updates** via **EventBridge**.
- **Python for ETL Processing**: Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
- **Power BI Dashboard** connected to **Redshift** for real-time visualization.
